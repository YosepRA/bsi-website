## Front-end

- Remove `collapse` and `show` state from all navbar elements. ✅
- Create a better box shadow for navbar.
- Exchange page:
  - Accordion header and body border radius to transition from 10px to 0px when active.
  - URLs for exchange pages. ✅
  - Direct scroll and open accordion.
- Navbar:
  - Use primary color as background. Adjust other colors such as text accordingly.
  - Change English language flag from UK to US. ✅
  - Active state.
  - Create a fixed positioned navbar. ✅
- Footer:
  - Ask for play store URLs.
  - Blurry Google Play Store button on 1600px+ screens.
- About us page:
  - Add Above The Fold (ATF) background image.
  - ATF background image to be transparent at the bottom. Use Photoshop if possible.
  - Set `max-width` for ATF body and image. Also center-align it.
- Button hover and active state.
- Smaller language flag right margin. ✅
- A feature to display the full-version of an image assets. The images will be small in mobile, that's not ideal.
- More modular page banner SCSS for Home and BSI pages.
- Cannot read text on banners for the low contrast against the banner images.
- Banner image background position.
- `main-container` new padding top to follow the new navbar height following the new logo.

## Back-end

- Language data middleware to be included in its own object. Don't spread the object directly.
- Migrate `index-v2.ejs` and all files related to it to be `index.ejs`.
- Delete Exchange page subcategories from dictionaries.
- Restructure nav items hierarchy on dictionaries according to navbar's orders.
