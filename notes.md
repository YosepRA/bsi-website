- About us page:
  - Add Above The Fold (ATF) background image.
  - ATF background image to be transparent at the bottom. Use Photoshop if possible.
  - Set `max-width` for ATF body and image. Also center-align it.
- Button hover and active state.
- Smaller language flag right margin. ✅
- A feature to display the full-version of an image assets. The images will be small in mobile, that's not ideal.
